 <p>  This article aims to outline concrete ways of approaching the road to competency. 
I have always been curious, knowing more excites me, I see competency as the ultimate success. Knowing how to do something thoroughly and expertly is not only a positive locally (people pay you), but it is also beneficial at a societal level (you solve real problems). This raises the question of, how one becomes competent. Below, I list routines/techniques/practices that make learning/working easier/faster, at least for me.   
</p>
1) <b>Think from the first principles </b>
<p>

First principles thinking refers to a philosophy where one tries to find the most fundamental axiom from which to 
work/build/learn. The goal is to find the most definitive truth about the situation and then work from there to
 find the solution. In the case of wanting to be competent, one needs to use first principles thinking in order to 
 figure out what he/she actually wants to be competent in. In other words, what exactly is the person trying to accomplish and why. Laying out the fundamental/most definitive reason for this helps down the road when you do not only have no motivation to continue but also when you are in doubt of the path you took. The goal is to pursue what you fundamentally believe in – and you only get to achieve this by boiling down your motives to their axiom/s. Why exactly do you want to be competent in X? What is your goal? How is skill X contributing to your goal/s? Why don’t you pursue skill Y? Why is X better than Y? Does pursuing skill X gives you meaning?

<b> 2) Allocate enough time to working/learning </b>
<p>


Dedicating an adequate amount of time to working is fundamental to learning. The goal here is to set a long enough time to get a good grasp of the content but short enough so that the opportunity cost of working remains bearable. This is where planning comes into play. The first thing you want to know is the timeline and milestones. Set yourself a hard deadline, this gives you something tangible to measure your success. Then, after setting a hard timeline, you want to structure your days such that it is easy to achieve the goal at hand. The idea here is to break your big deadlines into smaller deadlines. Another way of thinking about this is that you want to break your big task into smaller tasks. A big task is intimidating and often leads to procrastination. Hence breaking the task into smaller pieces until the initial piece seems less scary. The main goal here is to set the bar reasonably low. Or, perhaps more intuitively, you want to set the task that you can do, that you will do. As time goes on, the bar that you set for yourself will automatically increase and you will start achieving more.
Back to allocating enough time to work/learn, the question might be how to do this. What are the practical steps of setting a schedule? I use an Excel file to plan and a Google calendar to structure my days. For example, I use an Excel file to document different tasks that need to be tackled this week and the Google calendar to allocate the time I will do the task. The Excel file is more of an overview file while the Google calendar is for scheduling the hours and minutes of my day. This is what works for me, there are numerous ways/tools that you can use to schedule your time, for example, Notion. The goal is to have a system/tool that can help you keep track of what needs to be done and when. A schedule decreases the number of things you have to remember (once something is on the schedule you can remove it from your short-term memory).  
Scheduling work is one – big – part of learning, the second part is actually learning. You want to use the time you have scheduled accordingly. When it comes to this, I try my best to practice the concept of Deep Work – which was coined by Cal Newport in his book Deep Work. The idea here is to try and eliminate distractions as much as possible as this helps in getting into a focused trance state. This is a state where one is unresponsive to external stimuli, they are just engaged in the work they are doing. An even deeper idea behind this theory is that to maximize efficiency, one needs to separate tasks into two categories: deep tasks and shallow tasks. The former refers to tasks that require a high level of focus. Coding, Data analysis, and academic writing are among the tasks I consider "deep tasks" in my life. Then, the latter refers to tasks that you can complete while using, say, 60% of your mental capacity, at least this is the way I like thinking about shallow tasks. These are tasks that are necessary but do not directly contribute to your goals. For example, in my personal life, shallow tasks involve reading emails. This is necessary, however, 98% of the time the emails I read do not directly contribute to my goal of, say, completing my mobile application or writing my dissertation. The goal with deep work is therefore to spend the best time of your day engaged in work that contributes significantly to your goals.

<b> 3) Avoid context switching (and multitasking) </b>

<p>
Context switching and multitasking often make one feel like he/she is being extremely productive – which, as most people can attest, is often not true. The most efficient way of working/studying/learning, I have found, is to focus on one project for maybe 3-4 consecutive days. This allows me to get into a mental state in which I am thinking about the problem all the time, when I am eating, showering, commuting et cetera. This is the state where most of my great ideas come from. Approaching learning/working this way makes one efficient, you don’t have to pay the fixed cost of “jogging your memory” every time you are about to work on the project – which is the cost you certainly have to pay when you multitask or context switch regularly. In other words, since you are thinking about the project all the time, you can just get to work without having to relearn or refamiliarize yourself with the task every time you do it. For example, it is better to create one application at a time than to create two. It is more efficient and effective to read one book at a time than to read multiple books.

<b> 4) Do what matters first  </b>

<p>
When I am studying or working, I have always found doing what is necessary first rewarding. This is mainly because most of the time what is necessary is enough. Of course, “just enough” is not enough to excel in any given task. However, you first have to do what is “just enough” to excel. Accomplishing “just enough” first gives you the freedom to be as creative as possible. This is simply because completing the necessary parts of the tasks as fast as possible leaves you with ample time to figure out other things – which helps you to become relatively more competent.  
In summary, achieving competency all boils down to hard work and efficiency.  Of course, there are things I did not mention in this article like diet and physical exercise – which are both things I pay a lot of attention to. They are extremely important as they give you the energy to learn in the first place. (I hope to write about these in the future.)
