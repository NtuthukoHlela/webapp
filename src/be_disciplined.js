We often betray ourselves by falling for short-term desires. This is mostly because we often do not ask ourselves—or, perhaps more accurately, avoid asking ourselves—what not sticking to our plan actually means. Put differently, we choose not to do the cost-benefit analysis of our hedonistic actions. The reason for this is simple: the cost is always higher than the benefit.

</p>

<p>
The cost of betraying yourself can be divided into two parts: opportunity cost and self-trust cost. The former is straightforward and obvious. For example, when you choose to watch Netflix during the time you are scheduled to study or go to the gym, the opportunity cost is the time spent at the gym and the benefits of that. You fall into the doom-scroll loop, and the opportunity cost is the benefit you would have gained from doing productive work.
</p>

<p>

The self-trust cost is less obvious. In this context, self-trust is the assurance you have in yourself that you will follow through on the things you promised yourself to do. In other words, self-trust means being reliable to yourself. When you consistently betray yourself, your self-trust depletes until it becomes negative.. You do not want to be in this position—a position where you do not trust yourself. Life is hard and full of unfortunate events. Today you lose your job, and tomorrow your loved one passes away. Tragic events are part of life, and the last thing you want during this time is depleted self-trust. You want to be able to believe yourself when you say you will work your way back to stability. You want to have trust in your ability to put your head down and do the work despite the circumstances. When you want to get something done—from trying to get back on your feet to chasing a wild goal—self-belief/self-trust is all you have. Protect it at all costs.

Discipline is the most important trait one can have. Carve it and always strive to be the most disciplined version of yourself. I must hasten to note that being disciplined does not mean you do not get tempted. It does not even mean that you do not fall into traps. It means that when you lose focus or fall into a trap, you acknowledge it and learn from it. You do not allow yourself to fall into the same trap again. One way to avoid traps is to choose your environment and people wisely. Just because you can resist temptation does not mean you should expose yourself to it. Be cognizant of who you spend most of your time with. It is indeed true that you are the average of the people you spend most of your time with. It is fine to sacrifice people or an environment for your goals. 
</p>

<p>

Also, be on your side. Sometimes we veer off track because we are trying to please other people. Sometimes this is necessary, but most of the time it is not. Therefore, always be on your side. I am not saying that you should be a selfish, egotistical, and narcissistic person. However, I am saying that, at the very least, consider your needs when negotiating. This is, surprisingly, hard—because we do not love ourselves that much. If you are not (truly) on your side, who is?
</p>

<p>

Be disciplined. Do not sacrifice who you could be for who you are.
